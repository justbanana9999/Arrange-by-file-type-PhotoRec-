# Arrange-by-file-type-PhotoRec-
Organize files generated by PhotoRec into a new directory.

This is for the person that has corrupted their Windows while trying to resize the partition for dual booting, had to recover their files with PhotoRec, and is now left with a jumbled mess of files. That person is me, and probably someone out there in the future, maybe you? Use this tool to organize your files based on file extension.

Only one file, and you need to change the variables inside it to match your case.

You can freely edit the extensions list to include more extensions to your liking. The extensions.txt file contains all extensions that PhotoRec can recover.

### Copies the files but can be set to move instead (change cp at line 39 to mv)

Make sure the directories are global, not relative.

I don't think this works on Windows.

Additional instructions are inside the main .sh file. Be **extremely** careful when inputting directories when copying. If you have additional space I would recommend copying instead of moving
