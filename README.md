# Arrange-by-file-type-PhotoRec-
Organize files generated by PhotoRec into a new directory.

This is for the person that has corrupted their Windows while trying to resize the partition for dual booting, had to recover their files with PhotoRec, and is now left with a jumbled mess of files. That person is me, and probably someone out there in the future, maybe you? Use this tool to organize your files based on file extension.

Only one file, and you need to change the variables inside it to match your case.

Moves the files but can be set to only copy.
